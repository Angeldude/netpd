#X text 22 43 [netpd-batch-download] is a wrapper around [netpd-patch-download]
and eases the download of many patches and/or abstractions.;
#X text 23 88 It supports three methods:;
#X text 36 104 * patch: download patch;
#X text 36 119 * abstraction: download abstraction;
#X text 36 134 * msg: message to be posted after previous download
finished;

batch was downloaded \, but can also be used for being notified about
a complete download of a certain patch/abstraction.;
#X text 24 208 [netpd-batch-download] tries to find a peer to download
from on its own \, but it's not its task to make sure that the requested
files exist on the remote peer.;
